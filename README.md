vocabulary quiz with backbone.js
================================

This is a small vocabulary trainer (intended for me to learn Russion). It was first implemented in "plain old jquery", this is a more sophisticated version with backbone.js.

Features missing:
* sync with a database
* add vocabulary

No vocabulary included, if you want to try this out you got to define a few Question objects and save them for yourself.
